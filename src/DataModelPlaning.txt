      Validation

      for builder:
        - can't have isHere and isNotHere for same entityProperty.
        - can't have more isHere for given entityProperty than there are entities that have that entityProperty.
        - can't have more isNotHere for given entityProperty than there are entities that don't have that entityProperty

      general:
      if LogicalCondition Grid is smaller than Puzzle Grid, LogicalCondition has relative positioning, otherwise the positioning is absolute.
